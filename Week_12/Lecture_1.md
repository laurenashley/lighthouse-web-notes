## Battle Plan (What are we going to build first?)

Basic CRUD app connecting to our PostgreSQL database, supporting the following arguments:

* `node cli-villains.js help # Display available commands`
* `node cli-villains.js index # List all villians`
* `node cli-villains.js show <ID> # Show single villain by ID`
* `node cli-villains.js new <NAME> <MOVIE> # Create a new villain`
* `node cli-villains.js edit <ID> <NAME> <MOVIE> # Update villain by ID`
* `node cli-villains.js delete <ID> # Delete villain by ID`
